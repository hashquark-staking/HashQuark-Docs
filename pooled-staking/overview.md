# Overview

## Pooled Staking Features

1. A Small Funds Custody Scheme (Funds Held in the Contract);
2. All information is publicly transparent and verifiable;
3. "Point" replacing "Liquidity", with a logic similar to "Liquid Staking";
4. The service provider is only responsible for the startup and withdrawal of nodes;

## Fundamental Information

**Terminology:**

> **`LastTotalPoint`**: the total supply of Points at the previous snapshot&#x20;
>
> **`LastTotalETH`**: the total value of ETH (including earnings) at the previous snapshot&#x20;
>
> **`Rate`**: the ratio based on data from the previous snapshot point (used for the current ETH/Point exchange rate)&#x20;
>
> **`CurrentPoint`**: the current total supply of Points&#x20;
>
> **`UserPoint`**: the userâ€™s total value of Points&#x20;
>
> **`UserPrincipal`**: the user's calculated ETH principal

**Calculation Formula:**

> **The Point value obtained from user deposits (DepositETH):**&#x20;
>
> AddPoint = DepositETH \* LastTotalPoint / LastTotalETH;&#x20;
>
> **The ETH (including commission fees) obtained from user withdrawals (WithdrawPoint):**&#x20;
>
> WithdrawalETH = WithdrawPoint \* LastTotalETH / LastTotalPoint;&#x20;
>
> **The withdrawal fee charged to the user:**
>
> Commission = (WithdrawalETH - WithdrawPoint / UserPoint \* UserPrinciple) \* CommissionFeeRate&#x20;
>
> **The ETH received by the user:**&#x20;
>
> ActualETH = WithdrawalETH - Commission

## User Deposit and Withdrawal Process

**deposit process:**

```mermaid

participant User    
participant ManagerContract
participant Wallet
participant Backend
participant ETH2.0DepositContract
User->> + ManagerContract: DepositWithValue 
ManagerContract ->> + Wallet: Value
ManagerContract-->> - User: Store UserPoint/Principle/CurrentPoint

loop Multi Times Per Day
Backend ->> Wallet: Check Wallet.Balance
Wallet -->> Backend: Wallet.Balance >= 32Ether + Threshold
Backend ->> +ManagerContract: Request deposit Ether to ETH2.0DepositContract
ManagerContract ->> Wallet: Call Deposit Ether to ETH2.0DepositContract
Wallet ->> ETH2.0DepositContract: deposit
ETH2.0DepositContract -->> Wallet: Succeed
Wallet -->> ManagerContract: Succeed
ManagerContract -->> -Backend: Succeed Then Notify Setup a New Node
end
```

**withdrawal process (when the balance of Wallet Contract is sufficient):**



```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant User    
participant ManagerContract
participant Wallet
participant CommissionReceiver
User ->> + ManagerContract: WithdrawETH 
ManagerContract ->> Wallet: Check Point is valid and Sufficiant Balance
Wallet -->> ManagerContract: Sufficiant Balance
ManagerContract ->> +Wallet: Call Transfer ETH
Wallet ->> CommissionReceiver: TransferCommission
Wallet ->> User: Transfer ETH
Wallet -->> -ManagerContract: Succeed
ManagerContract -->> - User: Succeed(Store UserPoint/UserPrinciple/CurrentPoint)
```

**withdrawal process (when the balance of Wallet Contract is insufficient):**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant User    
participant ManagerContract
participant Wallet
participant CommissionReceiver
participant Manager
User ->> + ManagerContract: WithdrawETH 
ManagerContract ->> Wallet: Check Point is valid and Sufficiant Balance
Wallet -->> ManagerContract: Unsufficiant Balance
ManagerContract ->> ManagerContract: Store to Queue and Emit Event
ManagerContract -->> - User: Succeed(Store UserPoint/UserPrinciple/CurrentPoint)

Manager ->> +ManagerContract: Wait Balance to be sufficiant or transfer Ether to Contract
loop Queue
ManagerContract ->> +Wallet: Call Transfer ETH
Wallet ->> CommissionReceiver: TransferCommission
Wallet ->> User: Transfer ETH
Wallet -->> -ManagerContract: Succeed
end
ManagerContract -->> -Manager: Succeed
```
